I&#8217;m free and I&#8217;m out, whereas many of my friends are still in prison.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the talk, she said the first names of the friends she was still campaigning to free: Nilufar, Sepideh, Mahvash, Fariba, Morad, Siamak, Emaad and Nargess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from West Hampstead in London, said she felt the continued unrest in Iran was no longer getting the attention it deserved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think when this whole uprising happened back in September 2022, there was a lot of momentum, but then, of course, the world moves on,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Headinthesand\">&#8216;Head-in-the-sand&#8217;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Her husband Richard Ratcliffe also commented on a\u00a0damning report by the Foreign Affairs Committee\u00a0on the Foreign Office&#8217;s handling of hostage diplomacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It highlighted examples of &#8220;ministerial clumsiness&#8221; and &#8220;hurtful comments&#8221; in its communication with families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Ratcliffe described it as an important report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the moment, cases like Nazanin&#8217;s are reasonably rare&#8230; but they&#8217;re growing, and that growth is something that the government is not really dealing with,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The head-in-the-sand &#8216;let&#8217;s hope we keep this at a low level&#8217; [approach] and manage it like you would with a really rare illness &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are a number of countries who are taking hostages, there aren&#8217;t many that make the media, there aren&#8217;t many that the government will acknowledge as hostages or even acknowledge as arbitrarily detained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll await to see whether the government says &#8216;yes, hands up, we need to get better&#8217; or whether what we get is a &#8216;we&#8217;ll carry on what we&#8217;re currently doing but we&#8217;ll tweak around the edges&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had both in my time&#8230; so let&#8217;s see what comes.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Foreign Office has been approached for comment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, it said: &#8220;The best interests of British national detainees is at the heart of our consular work and we support and work with their families wherever we can.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: &#8216;Readjusting to UK life was hard&#8217; Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has said readjusting to life in the UK after six years in an Iranian jail had been slower than she had expected.
